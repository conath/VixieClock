## Notes

This app was created as a hobby project in February 2024 and was available on the App Store.
(my developer account has since expired)

The name "Vixie Clock" is a wordplay. 
The appearance of this clock is inspired by Nixie Tubes,
which show the time using a glowing filament for each digit.
The letter V is in reference to Vision Pro, the device this app was made for.

This app was built for and tested with visionOS 1.0 and Vision Pro.

## Marketing text

Inspired by the iconic Nixie Tube timepieces, this virtual clock is meticulously designed to seamlessly fit into any workspace or living area, effortlessly adding a touch of sophistication to your surroundings.
Its minimalist design and adjustable size make it a versatile addition to your mixed reality space.
